# book library

### you can log in, create, read, like/dislike books
### admin can create book on behalf of any user
### you can auth with google or auth0

github vulnerability bot send me a lot of notifications about deps, so be careful with it

to connect dp you should create mongodb user (also online), put creds in config file and you should be fine
